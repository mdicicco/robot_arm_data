# robot_arm_data
Research data about robot manipulators, scraped from public online sources

All data is collected from corporate websites, company catalogs, resellers, or random blog posts.  I tried to make notes of strange sources in the additional notes column when necessary.  Occasionally some of the estimates were in euros, so the conversion to dollars may be out of date.

Updated info is welcome via pull request.

I hope to update with processing and visualization scripts as they are written.
